<h1>About the project</h1>
Web based quote generator that is easy to use. Made from scratch by me using HTML/CSS/JS
<h2>Description</h2>
This web based quote generator allows users to pick from 30 predefined quotes from different categories. Users can also opt to choose quotes only from certain categories. It also has an information page that explains how the generator works, and a quotes page in case users want to check the full list of quotes.
